# Day 02 - Advent Calendar Challenge ðŸŽ„

## Challenge Description
Improve the user experience of an advent calendar. The initial design is basic, lacks interactivity, and is visually unappealing. The goal of this challenge is to:

- Enhance the design to make it visually appealing.
- Add interactive functionality, making it more engaging and festive.
- Incorporate accessibility and responsiveness to ensure a great user experience for everyone.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Improved UI/UX:**
2. **Added Interactivity:**
3. **Accessibility Improvements:**
   
## Stretch Goals Implemented
- **Day Interaction:** Clicking each day toggles between its "open" and "closed" state.
- **Random Gifts:** Displayed a random Christmas gift or message when a day is opened.
- **Celebratory Animation:** A festive animation appears on the 24th day to celebrate Christmas Eve.
- **State Preservation:** Calendar state is saved in `localStorage`, so users' progress is maintained across sessions.
